Experiment No. 04
To learn nmap installation and use this to scan different ports.

[1] Installation: 
	sudo apt-get install nmap (already done)

[2] Scan a System with Hostname and IP Address
	nmap www.shahandanchor.com
	nmap (IP address - copy from above result)

[3] Scan using "-v" option
	nmap -v www.shahandanchor.com

[4] Scan a whole subnet
	nmap 192.96.210.* (Put 4th octet as *)

[5] Scan a list of host from a file
      # cat > test.txt
	localhost
	google.com
	(IP address) 
	-close the file-
      # nmap -iL test.txt

[6] Scan an IP address range
	nmap 192.96.210.12-20 

[7] Scan OS information and Traceroute
	nmap -A 192.96.210.12

[8] Enable OS Detection with Nmap
	sudo nmap -O 192.96.210.12

[9] Scan a Host to Detect Firewall
	sudo nmap -sA 192.96.210.12

[10] Find out Live hosts in a Network
	nmap -sP 192.96.210.*

[11] Perform a Fast Scan
	nmap -F 192.96.210.12

[12] Find Nmap version
	nmap -V

[13] Scan for specific Port
	nmap -p 80 google.com

[14] Check most commonly used Ports with TCP Syn
	nmap -sT 192.96.210.12

[15] Scan a UDP Port
	sudo nmap -sU 192.96.210.12
